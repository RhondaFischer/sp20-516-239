## Data Center 2

Apple's Reno data center was opened in 2012.  It was designed to use 80% of water for cooling than previous data centers.  It received the  U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED certification for conserving water and energy, reducing waste, and using renewable energy.  The data center is 375,000 sqft.  It uses 100% renewable energy through the Neveda Green Rider solar project.

## Data Center 4, other renewable energy  

Biogas fuel cells transform waster streams directly into electricity, with zero emissions.  Apple has data centers using biogas fuel cells, including Maiden, NC and Cupertino, CA.  


## Data Center 5, UPS efforts towards renewables

UPS, the global logistics company, aims to reduce absolute Greenhouse Gas emissions 12 percent across our global ground operations by 2025 with these 3 targets:

* Source 25% of total electricity needs from renewable sources by 2025;
* Source 40% of ground fuel from low carbon or alternative fuels by 2025; and
* Expand their  laboratory – 25% of annual vehicle purchases by 2020 will be alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles

UPS uses an integrated pickup and delivery system to optimize network to reduce inefficiency and environmental impact.  The company uses a "rolling laboratory" of more than 10,000 vehicles to using alternative fuels, e.g. electric, electric hybrids, e-bikes, hydrogen fuel cell, hydraulic hybrid, propane, compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquefied natural gas (LNG).  

UPS reports its progress on sustainability goals.  By 2020, UPS has 25% of total vehicles purchased annually that are alternative fuel or advanced technology vehicles.
